## Accessing Mongo Express

Mongo-express would take time to access mongo database. So if we jump to the browser and try to access it after running `docker compose up`, we would get an error. ðŸ’¡ Just wait for the these lines to appear on the terminal ðŸ‘‡:


```
mongo-express-1  | No custom config.js found, loading config.default.js
mongo-express-1  | Welcome to mongo-express 1.0.2
mongo-express-1  | ------------------------
mongo-express-1  | 
```

#### Mongo express credentials

See values inside the double quote. These lines also appears on the terminal when mongo-express is ready.


```
mongo-express-1  | Server is open to allow connections from anyone (0.0.0.0)
mongo-express-1  | basicAuth credentials are "admin:pass", it is recommended you change this in your config.js!
```
